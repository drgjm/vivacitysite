    <p>Vivacity Choir is a fun and friendly community choir based in Sheffield, UK.
We are open to all, especially those new to singing. Inspired by "Last Choir
Standing" and wanting to create something fun and accessible to new singers,
we started in 2008.</p>
<p>We normally practice at 8:00pm on Monday evening in Hillsborough.</p>
<p>We welcome anyone regardless of experience. You don't need to be able to read
music but we are keen to help you learn. We are a group of about 60 singers,
two accompanists and our MD. We have three intakes a year (January, May and
September). Our Alto and Soprano sections are full but if you would like to
be put on the waiting list should a place become available please contact us
using the enquiry form. We have some places available for new Tenors
and Basses. Our next intakes are 13th May and 1st September 2013.</p>
<p>We aim to sing a variety of music styles including classical, contemporary
and gospel music. Please see our Repertoire page.</p>
